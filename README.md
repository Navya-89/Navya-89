#  Hi there!! üñê


I'm Navya Pragathi, a Graduate Student at Northeastern University. 

Having done my undergraduation in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from NITW, my passion for data started when I was tasked to retrieve data from a micro-controller and to program it to perform some gestures. Since then, my interest in this field has only grown with time. I gravitate more towards Data Science and Data Analysis. Working in this sector of various MNC's like Tata Power and Logitech has helped me gain relevant experience in the industry. 

As business today are becoming more linked with information technology, I strive to utlize my expertise to bridge the gap between technology and business.
